              <h2>Expieriement Website is the wrong writed of 'Experiment Webiste'!</h2>
              <p>
                Yes, I was to name it is <b>Expieriement's Website</b>. And you aren't heard wrong. This website is Expieriement's Website.
                It wasn't <b>I</b> was named 'Expieriement'! As the greetings was say, Expieriement is the <b>wrong</b> writed of Experiment! 
                The website was made to becoming the personal website and we called it 'PWP', just like your PC, it's a <b>acronym</b>, 
                it's stand for <b>P</b>ersonal <b>C</b>omputer. This website just don't need a domain for a just PWP, don't need a domain and hosting.
                But look, the domain 'Glitch.Me', like this website are <i>Glitched</i>, right? Right now, i'm already have it. As I go to 
				        glitch.com and I have it, nor I already have it before, just beacause I want to website is appear 
				        on the Internet so I got to do it. Glitch.com has only 512MB of RAM when <b>boost</b>, disk size just 
				        200MB when <b>boost</b>. That so small. The only I needed is the <b>disk size</b> but, you see, that was so <i>small</i>! I'm trying 
				        to getting money to buy the own domain and hosting. It's so <i>boring</i> and we was <i>tired</i>! You work it's just donate and 
                feedback the mail. I'm on behalf of the group, please you to <b>donate us and supporting us</b> by sending the feedback mail at the 
                mail showed at the Startpage.

              <h2>Now, I will tell you the Story of how this web could be made.</h2>
              <p>
                First, I just coding this page in my computer, run it on my browser, using local host for running. That time I don't use CSS to coding 
                so my first 'website' look <i>terrible</i>! I decided to learn CSS. And, I learned CSS! But, if my 'website' it's storaged only on my PC, 
                how people and everyone could access to my 'website'? I knew it! To bring it on the website you just need a domain name like Google has 
                google.com, Microsoft has microsoft.com, etc.. So I searched for domain name and how to get, are that just enter on the address bar 
                and it automatically create a own website, free domain and hosting and I just need to coding on them. But not! The domain and hosting 
                aren't free. You need to buy them. At this time, I don't have an any money, 'cause I just a <b><i>Student</i></b>! 
                I created a group that everyone can develop the page. We searched all but all website we searched it's all needing money. 
                I know where to code in! It's Glitch.com. We goto glitch.com and create a project, make website 
                in there. 
                Now we are completely create website, but it's just in development. So we hope you <b>Donate and Feedback</b> the error 
                or the missing of this website and we will fix it! 
                And today! 30/7/2021, the Glitch.Me server was disconected to me, I was so very angry beacause I am developing my webpage and then, 
                Boom! The website said: "Uh oh, sorry, we just disconected to Glitch, which is means this <i>unsaved</i>, please close this tab or 
                refresh this page again.". As I was said, the domain "Glitch.Me" was look just like. Like this website is was <b><i>Glitched</i></b>! 
                Ohhhhhh my! I was just relized I've forgot my best thing!! It's <a href="https://github.com">Github.Com</a>. My my!
